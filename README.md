## Flickr Gallery
[LIVE DEMO](https://aquamarine-kangaroo-76b7ce.netlify.app)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment vars
This project requires one Flickr API key to be able of fetch the photos
Set up the **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY** env var with a valid API Key

You can learn more about this in here [Get you API KEY](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/)

## Tests
```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

## Considerations
- I'm working on this example app in my spare time, out of my working hours.
